- **Let your Pet Sleep**: Allow your pet to rest and recharge its energy.
- **Manage Mood**: Your pet's mood changes based on how well you care for it. Keep it happy and avoid sadness!

## 🛠️ Skills Utilized

This project demonstrates a variety of skills in web development and React.js, including:

### 1. **React.js Fundamentals**

- **State Management**: Effectively manage and update the pet's stats (hunger, happiness, energy, sadness) using React's `useState` hook.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Break down the app into reusable components like `Pet`, `Stats`, and `Controls`, promoting clean and maintainable code.

### 2. **Event Handling**

- Implement interactive features such as feeding, playing, and sleeping by handling events triggered by user actions.
- Update the pet’s mood and stats dynamically based on these actions, providing a responsive user experience.

### 3. **Conditional Rendering**

- Display different pet moods using conditional rendering based on the pet's current state.
- Ensure that the appropriate GIF and mood description are shown according to the pet's happiness, energy, and sadness levels.

### 4. **CSS Styling**

- **Custom Design**: Create an engaging and fun visual style for the game, including the circular pet display, playful colors, and responsive layout.
- **CSS Animation**: Utilize CSS to animate the pet's reactions and provide visual feedback when the user interacts with the pet.

### 5. **File Structure & Organization**

- Organize the project into meaningful directories (`components`, `assets`, `styles`) to maintain clarity and scalability as the project grows.
- Separate concerns by isolating logic, presentation, and assets, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend.

### 6. **Image Handling**

- Use dynamic image paths to show different pet moods, demonstrating an understanding of asset management in React.
- Ensure images load correctly and are displayed within the designed UI constraints.

### 7. **Responsive Design**

- Implement a layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the game looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Use CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive user interface.

### 8. **User Experience (UX) Design**

- Focus on creating an intuitive and enjoyable experience for users, allowing them to easily interact with their virtual pet.
- Provide instant feedback through visual cues and mood changes to keep the gameplay engaging.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- **React Mastery**: Improved understanding of state management, component-based design, and dynamic rendering in React.
- **UI/UX Design**: Gained experience in designing user-friendly interfaces with a focus on visual appeal and usability.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developed problem-solving skills by troubleshooting issues related to dynamic image rendering and event handling.
- **Collaboration Ready**: The project structure and clean codebase make it easy to collaborate with other developers, preparing you for team-based projects.
